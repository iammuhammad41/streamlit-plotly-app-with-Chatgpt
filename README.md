# **Streamlit + Plotly + ChatGPT Dashboard**

This application integrates **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **ChatGPT** to create an interactive dashboard. Users can visualize data through Plotly charts while interacting with ChatGPT to get insights based on the displayed graphs.

## **Features:**

* **Interactive Data Visualization**: View and interact with dynamic charts created using Plotly.
* **ChatGPT Integration**: Ask questions about the visualized data, and receive intelligent responses powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
* **Sidebar Input**: Enter text in the sidebar to ask ChatGPT questions.
* **Multiple Visualizations**: Includes bar charts and scatter plots, which can be customized based on your dataset.

## **Requirements:**

To run this app, the following Python packages are required:

* **Streamlit**: Web framework to build interactive dashboards.
* **Plotly**: For generating interactive plots.
* **OpenAI**: For ChatGPT integration.

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit plotly openai
```

## **Setup:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have an OpenAI API key. You can obtain it from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key` in the code with your actual API key.

```python
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'
```

4. Run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_chatgpt_plotly.py
```

This command will start a local server and open the app in your default web browser.

## **How it works:**

1. **Interactive Data Visualization**: The app includes interactive charts that can be explored and analyzed. For example, a bar chart of fruit quantities and a scatter plot of prices versus quantities.
2. **ChatGPT Interaction**: In the sidebar, you can input a question like "Which fruit has the highest quantity?" or "What is the relationship between quantity and price?" and get responses generated by ChatGPT.
3. **Data Source**: The sample app uses a synthetic dataset of fruits with attributes like quantity, price, etc. You can replace this with your own dataset.

## **Example Questions for ChatGPT**:

* "What is the highest quantity of fruits?"
* "Which fruit has the lowest price?"
* "Tell me about the relationship between quantity and price."

## **Customization:**

* Replace the synthetic dataset with your own dataset (e.g., from a CSV file or a database).
* Modify or add more visualizations based on your data needs.
